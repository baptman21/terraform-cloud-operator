## 2.4.0 (May 07, 2024)

NOTES:

* The `Workspace` CRD has been changed. Please follow the Helm chart instructions on how to upgrade it. [[GH-390](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator/pull/390)]
* In upcoming releases, we shall proceed with renaming this project to HCP Terraform Operator for Kubernetes or simply HCP Terraform Operator. This measure is necessary in response to the recent announcement of [The Infrastructure Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud). The most noticeable change you can expect in version 2.6.0 is the renaming of this repository and related resources, such as the Helm chart and Docker Hub names. Please follow the changelogs for updates. [[GH-393](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cloud-operator/pull/393)]
